We'are sorry this mod isn't available in 1.15.2 or below, because this mod has a new version of the ore generation code.

This mod requires: 
* Fabric api;
* Minecraft 1.16.2 (We aren't sure if 1.16 runs out of it);
* Fabric loader (better if 0.9.0 or above).

## BUG Found
- The six ore (please refer to the manual for details) can be mined with stone pickaxe and wooden pickaxe. Our goal is to prevent it from being mined with wooden pickaxe and stone pickaxe. This will be fixed in the next version.
- The five gem blocks (please see the manual for details) can be mined with stone pickaxe and wooden pickaxe. Our goal is to prevent it from being mined with wooden pickaxe and stone pickaxe. This will be fixed in the next version.
